# SanScript

The development of SanScript centers around three key components: Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter. These components work in harmony to process and execute the SanScript code. Here's a brief overview of each:

## Lexer:

- The Lexer is responsible for breaking down the code into meaningful units called tokens.
- Tokens are the building blocks that represent the fundamental elements of the code, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators.

## Parser:

- The Parser acts as an architect, creating a structured plan known as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the code, capturing its syntax and semantics in a more organized manner.

## Interpreter:

- The Interpreter takes the AST and executes the plan, bringing the SanScript code to life.
- It ensures the smooth functionality of the code, step by step, aligning with the principles of JavaScript.

The choice of a file extension for SanScript code is .lipi, and to execute the code, one needs to navigate to the SanScript folder and run the following command:

`node SanScript.js <filename.lipi>`
